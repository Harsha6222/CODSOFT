# CodSoft Internship Projects
Welcome to my CodSoft Internship Projects repository! This repository contains the tasks I completed as part of my virtual educational internship at CodSoft, focusing on C++ programming.

Overview :
As part of the CodSoft internship, I was assigned a series of tasks to enhance my skills in C++ programming. In this repository, you'll find the projects I worked on during the internship.

Completed Tasks:

Task 1: Number Guessing Game
A fun interactive game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a given range.

Task 2: Simple Calculator
A basic calculator program that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Task - 3: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players, where they take turns marking a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O." The game checks for wins or draws and allows players to play multiple rounds.

Task 4: To-Do List
A simple console-based to-do list application that allows users to add, remove, and manage their tasks efficiently.

Project Structure
Each task is organized into its own directory, containing the source code, documentation, and sample outputs for reference.
